## Description

This application uses a full CRUD environment using mongoDB and moongoose to create a simple fitness tracker application. The user is able to view their last workout and see the date, total duration of the workout and more on the home page. Additionally they can add new workouts, either cardio or resistance workout; or they could add to the current workout being shown.  If added to the current workout, the data will be updated to show the new totals. 

The user can also view a dashboard with charts to review total workout duration and pounds lifted in the last 7 days.
